# Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-and-FastAPI
Image Classifier with FastAPI (Python)  Built a 92% accurate image classifier (CNNs) using TensorFlow &amp; Keras.  Preprocessed data (normalization &amp; augmentation) for 15% model robustness boost. Created real-time prediction API (FastAPI) with 200ms response time.
